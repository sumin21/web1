  <h2>Summer</h2>
  <p>
    It's just June 1st as I type this and my local newspaper, an airport
    parking service is already advertising for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer" target="_blank"
    title="summer.com">summer</a>. Also, a newscast
    mentioned before the break that water restrictions would be enforced until
    the end of the summer, and mentioned after the break that the summer water
    watering restrictions begins today, which mean that summer would begin 50
    days before a typical American calendar mentions "summer begins" and 21
    days before the "first day of fall."

    In addition, the long hyped up summer
    blockbuster season (formerly mentioned in this article) begins this Friday,
    May 5th. Boston.com on the link http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/
    articles/2006/04/30/festival_season_is_upon_us/ lists "SUMMER EVENTS IN
    BOSTON" starting on May 10th, well before true summer weather arrives in
    Boston.
