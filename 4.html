  <h2>Winter</h2>

    " Another psycological view is also that due to not getting light and not
    letting the body shut down for the winter as it usually would do
    (due to humans not being able to hibernate very long and that we must
    get up for work, school, etc.) makes us all very crabby and unpleasant when
    we would prefer to sleep and cannot migrate down south for the <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter" target="_blank" title="winter.com">
    winter</a> all
    the time, but that when we do travel towards the equator in the winter,
    to say Hawaii and Mexico, we do feel happier, but that may partially be
    due to the fact that we get to travel."
