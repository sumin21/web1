  <h2>Autumn</h2>
  <p>
    A very large number of words and phrases, many of them now exclusively
    American, are similar survivals from the English of the seventeenth century,
    long since obsolete or merely provincial in England. Among nouns Thornton
    notes fox-fire, flap-jack, jeans, molasses, beef (to designate the live
    animal), chinch, cordwood, home-spun, ice-cream, julep and swingle-tree;
    Halliwell1 adds andiron, bay-window, cesspool, clodhopper, cross-purposes,
    greenhorn, loop-hole, ragamuffin and trash; and other authorities cite stock
    (for cattle), fall (for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn"
    target="_blank" title="autumn.com">
    autumn</a>), offal, din, underpinning and adze.

    Bub,
    used in addressing a boy, is very old English, but survives only in American.
    Flapjack goes back to Piers Plowman, but has been obsolete in England for
    two centuries. Muss, in the sense of a row, is also obsolete over there,
    but it is to be found in “Anthony and Cleopatra.” Char, as a noun, disappeared
    from English a long time ago, save in the compound, charwoman, but
    it survives in America as chore. Among the verbs similarly preserved are to
    whittle, to wilt and to approbate. To guess, in the American sense of to
    suppose, is to be found in “Henry VI”:
