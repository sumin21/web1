  <h2>Spring</h2>
  <p>
    I was thinking about rewriting this page so it is more like the other
    disambig pages. Before I do (assuming no one else does first), I'm curious
    what exactly you mean. By "in the plain" do you mean that they should all
    be in a neat list or that their full titles should be shown. It would look
    better to me if this page had something like "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring" target="_blank" title="spirng.com">Spring</a>,
    a source of water in
    the ground" or something like that (I'm just doing a rough definition off
    the top of my head) with the parentheses hidden, but that makes me curious
    if there is a recommended policy on that. In the America disambig page, all
    the entries with parentheses have that part hidden, and that personally
    looks better to me than "Spring (water), a source of water in the ground."

  <p>Also, what do you mean by your city entry comment? I see putting all the
    cities together at the bottom as a reminder that those articles also exist,
    but I don't understand why you would exclude something because it was
    capitalized. I just want to make sure I understand policies/recommendations
    regarding disambig pages before I start making major changes to this one
    and others. Thanks! -- Jrdioko 01:45, Apr 9, 2004 (UTC)
