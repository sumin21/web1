  <h2>Diary</h2>
  <p>
    (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by date
    reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period.
    A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or
    feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct
    experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a diarist. Diaries
    undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human
    civilization, including government records (e.g. Hansard), business ledgers,
    and military records. In British English, the word may also denote a
    preprinted journal format. A diary is a collection of notes.
